## How it works

Fibonacci LFSRs

A 16-bit Fibonacci LFSR.  The feedback tap numbers shown correspond to a primitive polynomial in the table, so the register cycles through the maximum number of 65535 states excluding the all-zeroes state.  The state shown, 0xACE1 (hexadecimal) will be followed by 0x5670.
Duration: 30 seconds. 0:30 
A Fibonacci 31-bit linear feedback shift register with taps at positions 28 and 31, giving it a maximum cycle and period at this speed of nearly 6.7 years.  The bit positions that affect the next state are called the taps.  In the diagram the taps are [16,14,13,11].  The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit which is always also a tap.  To obtain the next state, the tap bits are XOR-ed sequentially; then, all bits are shifted one place to the right, with the rightmost bit being discarded, and that result of XOR-ing the tap bits is fed back into the now-vacant leftmost bit.  To obtain the pseudorandom output stream, read the rightmost bit after each state transition.
